       " Document(page_content='THE TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM 2\\n1 Statement Of The Problem\\nThe traveling salesman problem involves a salesman who must make a tour\\nof a number of cities using the shortest path available and visit each city\\nexactly once and only once and return to the original starting point. For\\neach number of cities n,the number of paths which must be explored is n!,\\ncausing this problem to grow exponentially rather than as a polynomial.\\nThere are bunch of algorithms oﬀering comparably fast running time and\\nstill yielding near optimal solutions.\\n2 History of The TSP\\nThe Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a problem whose solution has\\neluded many mathematicians for years. Currently there is no solution\\nto the TSP that has satisﬁed mathematicians. Historically, mathematics\\nrelated to the TSP was developed in the 1800’s by Sir William Rowan\\nHamilton and Thomas Penyngton Kirkman, Irish and British mathemati-\\ncians, respectively. Hamilton was the creator of the Icosian Game in 1857.\\nIt was a pegboard with twenty holes that required each vertex to be vis-\\nited only once, no edge to be visited more than once, and the ending point\\nbeing the same as the starting point.This kind of path was eventually re-\\nferred to as a Hamiltonian circuit.However, the general form of the TSP\\nwas ﬁrst studied by Karl Menger in Vienna and Harvard in the late 1920’s\\nor early 1930’s.\\nTSP?s were ﬁrst studied in the 1930?s by mathematician and economist\\nKarl Menger in Vienna and Harvard. It was later investigated by Hassler\\nWhitney and Merrill Flood at Princeton.\\nIn 1994, Applegate, Bixby , Chvatal, and Cook solved TSP containing\\n7,397 cities. Later in 1998, they solved it using 13,509 cities in United\\nStates. In 2001, Applegate, Bixby, Chvtal, and Cook found the optimal\\ntour of 15,112 cities in Germany. Later in 2004, TSP of visiting all 24,978\\ncities in Sweden was solved; a tour of length of approximately 72,500\\nkilometers was found and it was proven that no shorter tour exists. This\\nis currently the largest solved TSP.', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Travelling Salesman.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Some\\nsolution methods of TSP include:\\n3.1 Exact Solutions\\n•Brute-force method.\\n•Branch and Bound.\\n3.1.1 Brute force method\\nWhen one thinks of solving TSP, the ﬁrst method that might come to mind\\nis a brute-force method.

       " Document(page_content='THE TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM 8\\n5 Optimization Techniques\\nOnce a tour has been generated by some tour construction heuristic, we\\nmight wish to improve that solution. There are several ways to do this,\\nbut the most common ones are the 2-opt and 3-opt local searches. Their\\nperformances are somewhat linked to the construction heuristic used.\\n5.1 2-opt and 3-opt\\nThe 2-Opt algorithm was ﬁrst proposed by Croes [1958], although the\\nbasic move had already been suggested by Flood [1956]. The 2-opt algo-\\nrithm basically removes two edges from the tour, and reconnects the two\\npaths created. This is often referred to as a 2-opt move.\\nThe 3-opt algorithm works in a similar fashion, but instead of removing\\ntwo edges we remove three. A 3-opt move can actually be seen as two or\\nthree 2-opt moves.\\nWe ﬁnish our search when no more 3-opt moves can improve the tour.\\nIf a tour is 3-optimal it is also 2-optimal.\\nWhen talking about the complexity of these k-opt algorithms, one\\ntends to omit the fact that a move can take up to O(n) to perform.A\\nnaive implementation of 2-opt runs in O(n2),this involves selecting an\\nedge ( c1, c2) and searching for another edge ( c3, c4), completing a move\\nonly if dist( c1, c2) + dist( c3, c4)>dist(c2, c3) + dist( c1, c4).\\nFigure 1: 2-Opt move', metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Travelling Salesman.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
